# ShindaPesa Backend Authentication Solution

## Problem Solved
You wanted to be able to login with your old credentials even after clearing app data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend User Storage
- **Updated backend** (`backend/index.js`) to store user accounts in memory
- **Added endpoints**:
  - `POST /register` - Register new users on server
  - `POST /login` - Authenticate users via server
  - `GET /users` - List all registered users
  - `GET /profile/:userId` - Get user profile

### 2. Hybrid Authentication System
- **Primary**: Uses backend server for authentication
- **Fallback**: Uses local storage if backend is unavailable
- **Smart error handling**: Provides clear messages for different scenarios

### 3. Updated Frontend (`src/utils/auth.ts`)
- **Backend integration**: Login and registration now use server
- **Automatic fallback**: If server is down, uses local storage
- **Credential persistence**: Still saves "Remember Me" locally

## How It Works Now

### Registration Process:
1. User registers → Account saved on backend server
2. Backup copy stored locally for offline access
3. User gets referral code and account details

### Login Process:
1. App tries to authenticate via backend server
2. If server available → Authenticates against server database
3. If server unavailable → Falls back to local storage
4. Credentials persist even after clearing app data (if server available)

### After Clearing App Data:
1. Local storage is cleared (as before)
2. But your account still exists on the backend server
3. Login will work because server has your credentials
4. Account data is restored from server

## Backend Features
- **In-memory storage**: User accounts stored on server
- **Referral system**: Works across server and local storage
- **Password validation**: Proper error messages
- **User management**: List and manage users

## Testing
1. **Start backend**: `cd backend && node index.js`
2. **Register user**: Will be saved on both server and locally
3. **Clear app data**: Removes local storage only
4. **Login again**: Will authenticate via server and restore account

## Files Modified
- `backend/index.js` - Added user management endpoints
- `src/utils/auth.ts` - Added backend integration with fallback
- Built new APK: `app-internal-debug.apk` (100.6 MB)

## Benefits
✅ **Persistent accounts**: Survive app data clearing
✅ **Server-side storage**: Accounts stored centrally  
✅ **Offline support**: Falls back to local storage
✅ **Better errors**: Clear messages about account status
✅ **Backward compatible**: Existing local accounts still work

## Next Steps
1. Install the updated APK
2. Make sure backend server is running
3. Register a new account (it will be saved on server)
4. Clear app data and try logging in - it will work!

The backend server must be running for the server-based authentication to work. If the server is down, the app will fall back to local storage mode.
