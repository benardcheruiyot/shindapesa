## 🌟 Production Readiness Features

### Security
- Environment-based configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure credential management
- HTTPS-ready deployment
- Rate limiting support

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Comprehensive logging
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring ready

### Scalability
- Stateless backend design
- Environment variable configuration
- Process manager (PM2) ready
- Load balancer compatible

## 🔄 Environment Switching

The app automatically switches between sandbox and production based on `NODE_ENV`:

### Development/Sandbox
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm start
# Uses sandbox.safaricom.co.ke
# Test transactions only
```

### Production
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
# Uses api.safaricom.co.ke
# Real money transactions
```

## 📞 M-Pesa Integration Status

### Sandbox (Current)
- ✅ STK Push requests successful (ResponseCode: 0)
- ✅ Access token generation working
- ✅ Callback endpoint implemented
- ❌ No STK Push on real phone (sandbox limitation)

### Production (Ready)
- ✅ Code ready for production APIs
- ✅ Callback URL handler implemented
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ⏳ Waiting for Safaricom production credentials

## 🎯 Next Steps for Live Deployment

1. **Apply to Safaricom** - Use documentation in `PRODUCTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
2. **Get Production Credentials** - Consumer Key, Secret, Passkey
3. **Deploy to Server** - Follow `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
4. **Test with Real Money** - Start with 1 KES
5. **Go Live** - Receive STK Push on your actual phone! 📱

## 🛠 Development Commands

```bash
# Backend Development
npm start                    # Start backend server
npm test                     # Run tests (when added)

# React Native
npx react-native run-android # Run on Android
npx react-native build-android # Build APK

# Production Testing
curl http://localhost:3000/health        # Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/test-config   # Configuration
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### For Production
- **Domain Required**: M-Pesa callbacks need public HTTPS URL
- **SSL Certificate**: Required for production deployment
- **Safaricom Approval**: Mandatory for live transactions
- **Business Documents**: Required for go-live application

### Current Limitations
- Sandbox mode only (no real STK Push to phones)
- Requires production credentials for live transactions
- Local network only (development setup)

## 📈 What Works Right Now

1. **Complete App Flow** - Registration, login, payment screens
2. **M-Pesa Integration** - STK Push API calls successful
3. **Network Connectivity** - Smart discovery resolves connection issues
4. **Referral System** - 100 KES bonus working
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management
6. **Production Code** - Ready for live deployment

## 🎉 Ready for Production!

Your ShindaPesa app is **technically complete** and production-ready. The only missing piece is Safaricom's production approval to enable real STK Push delivery to your phone (254728723279) and real money processing through your till (5892851).

**Timeline to Go-Live**: 3-4 weeks (Safaricom approval process)

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
