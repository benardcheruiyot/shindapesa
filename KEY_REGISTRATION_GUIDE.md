# IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Upload Key Registration

## 🚨 The Issue is Clear Now

Google Play is rejecting your new upload key because it's **not registered**. Even though Google Play App Signing is enabled, you need to explicitly register the new upload key.

## ✅ Ready Files

### For Google Play Registration
- **Certificate:** `upload-certificate.pem` ✅ Created and ready
- **AAB:** `app-release-v1.5-new-key.aab` ✅ Built and ready

### Certificate Details
- **New Upload Key SHA1:** `1F:D9:08:06:0D:2B:66:B6:0A:2F:8C:5C:47:98:AF:F1:00:7B:84:A4`
- **Google Play Expects:** `4B:92:E2:43:A1:23:75:5D:06:20:17:5C:3D:57:C4:3F`
- **Solution:** Register the new key with Google Play

## 🚀 ACTION PLAN

### Option 1: Console Registration (Try First)
1. **Google Play Console** → Your App → **Release** → **Setup** → **App signing**
2. Look for **"Upload key certificate"** or **"Add upload key"**
3. Upload: `upload-certificate.pem`

### Option 2: Contact Support (Most Reliable)
**Go to Google Play Console Help and send this message:**

```
Subject: Register new upload key for Google Play App Signing

App: PataPesa (com.nativeapp)

We need to register a new upload key for our app because the original signing key is not available. Google Play App Signing is enabled for this app.

Current situation:
- Google Play expects SHA1: 4B:92:E2:43:A1:23:75:5D:06:20:17:5C:3D:57:C4:3F
- Our new upload key SHA1: 1F:D9:08:06:0D:2B:66:B6:0A:2F:8C:5C:47:98:AF:F1:00:7B:84:A4

Please register the attached certificate (upload-certificate.pem) as a valid upload key for this app.

Thank you!
```

**Attach:** `upload-certificate.pem`

### Option 3: Internal Testing Route
1. **Release** → **Testing** → **Internal testing**
2. Upload `app-release-v1.5-new-key.aab`
3. Follow any key registration prompts

## ⏰ Timeline
- **Support response:** 1-2 business days

## 🎯 Next Steps After Registration
1. Upload `app-release-v1.5-new-key.aab` to Production

**The hard work is done - this is just an administrative step with Google Play!** 🚀
