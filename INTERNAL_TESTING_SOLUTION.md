## 🚀 Try This First (5 Minutes)

This approach sometimes bypasses production certificate restrictions and allows Google Play to register your new upload key automatically during the upload process.

## ✅ Ready Files Confirmed
- **Production AAB:** `app-release-v1.5-new-key.aab` (41.4 MB)

2. **Select:** Your PataPesa app
3. **Navigate:** Release → Testing → **Internal testing**
4. **Click:** "Create new release"

### 2. Upload Your AAB
1. **Upload:** `app-release-v1.5-new-key.aab`
2. **Watch for prompts:** Google Play may show certificate registration options

## 🎯 What to Expect

### ✅ Success Scenarios:
